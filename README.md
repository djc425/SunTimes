# SunTimes
An original project making use of custom UITableViewCells, SF symbols, date formatting, json parsing, date and time formatting. 

I wanted to create a project that allowed users to quickly check their location, and see the current and next day's sunset and sunrise times. To accomplish that I built a single page app, where user's can quickly check their location, and then between two buttons, toggle between the rise and set times of the sun and moon local to them. From the API call I also pull the current day's length and display that within a label below the UITableView. 

Some fun challenges in this project where not only building those custom cells, but also learning about date and time formatting based on what was received from the API call. Recently I've refactored this project to make sure of the Result type.
