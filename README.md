# SunTimes
An original project making use of custom UITableViewCells, date formatting, json parsing, and handling user location. 

What was both fun and frustrating with this project was building my own UITableviewCell class, using a user's location, and parsing data from the sunset and sunrise times API which can be found at the following URL https://sunrise-sunset.org/api.
