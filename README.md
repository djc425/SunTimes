# SunTimes
An original project making use of custom UITableViewCells, SF symbols, date formatting, json parsing, date and time formatting based on the json data, and handling user location. 

I wanted to create a project that allowed users to quickly check their location, and see the current and next day's sunset and sunrise times. To accomplish that I built a single page app, where user's can quickly check their location, and then between two buttons, toggle between the rise and set times of the sun and moon local to them and then see the times displayed in a custom UITableViewCell. 

Some fun challenges in this project where not only building those custom cells, but also learning about date and time formatting based on what was received from the API call. I parsed the data from the sunset and sunrise times API which can be found at the following URL https://sunrise-sunset.org/api.
